Both myself and a friend of mine like fishing in Terraria because it's pretty relaxing [i]and[/i] pretty useful through early hardmode. I've always thought about "what if there was this fish" or "why isn't there a tundra biome crate?" though and I'm guessing everyone else has as well. [b]Tacklebox[/b] aims to fill in those gaps left throughout the vanilla fishing experience and flesh out fishing a little more throughout the game.

I tried my best to make it everything neat, balanced, and pretty, but it's not easy to do alone. If anyone wants to help me fix or add stuff, check out the [b]Known Issues[/b] and [b]Wishlist[/b] sections and let me know if you'd like to help me out, I'd really appreciate it!

[color=#ff9999]This mod is [b]NOT[/b] fully tested/some things are not fully implemented yet! It won't, like, explode your game, but some of the content might be buggy...[/color]

[spoiler=33 New Fish (9 Foods)]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/BpAKFZp.png[/img]
These fish mostly fill out the areas currently kinda neglected; like Honey, Lava (which was a huge disappointment to me once I finally got my Hotline), Mushroom (none?!), Desert, and Dungeon fish. Additionally, I tried to add a good variety in the uses of each fish, barring a few penny-fetchers.

[spoiler=9 Fishing Poles (6 Baits)]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/zIP9THO.png[/img]
These should fill the gaps between rods throughout the game if you're one of those Terrarians who fishes his or her way through thick and thin. Additionally, there are some rather exotic ones...

Fishing doesn't have to be a competition, you and the fish can both win with these scrumptious sea-snacks! Each new bait adds a unique dynamic to fishing in its own way; except the Gold Jelly, that's just keeping with tradition.
[list]
[*] [b]Guppy[/b] - 10 bait power, attracts more big fish

[/list]
[/spoiler]

[spoiler=7 Potions (9 Buffs)]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/Ks8Ltu9.png[/img]
Naturally, if there's new fish there's new potions. I've also added a few combination potions; they serve primarily to synchronize the durations of their constituent potions using their mean time, but the Alchemy Table effect still applies if you catch my drift...
[list]
[*] [b]Frog Potion[/b] - Crafted from Frog + Any Butterfly + Bottled Water @ bottle, grants Leapfrog buff for 6 minutes

[img]http://i.imgur.com/ItMxe9i.png[/img]
You can put these on your body and thus become better at fishing, because that's how Terraria works! Please note: None of the following unique effects are stackable; for example, Gold Hook, Platinum Hook, and Fishing Rod Kit will all only increase fishing power by 5.

[spoiler=Other Stuff!]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/eusArUb.png[/img]
You've no doubt wondered at some point (possibly every day) why there's no Frozen Crate if there's a Frozen Chest, or why the Ocean, home of seaworthy toddlers, doesn't have its own crate. Well, now they're here!
[list]
[*] [b]Broken Sonar[/b] - 2% chance from Iron Crates

[/list]

[img]http://i.imgur.com/lfZB9nL.png[/img]

[size=6]Wishlist[/size]

[spoiler=Stuff I'd like to add eventually...]
[list]
[*] [b]Endgame Fishing[/b] - Some content for jungle temple, lunar events, and beyond which makes fishing a useful supplementary feature into late game and a worthwhile hobby further

[/list]

These would be crafted from various fish caught before (Scaly) and after (Ichthyoid) hardmode with pretty early normal/hardmode stats and fish-related bonuses. I think it'd be super cool!

[/list]

[list]
[*] [b]Quest Fish[/b] - I would really really like to add some but it was difficult enough for me spriting all the other fish
[*] [b]Big Mouth Bass[/b] - Big Mouth Billy Bass plaque quest reward
[*] [b]Golden Guppy Statue[/b] - Quest reward after 25 quests
[*] [b]Golden Shark Statue[/b] - Quest reward after 50 quests
[*] [b]Aquariums[/b] - Would take a lot of work...

[*] [b]Slippery Lure[/b] - fish stay hooked half as long, 2% chance after 5 quests
[*] [b]Puffy Lure[/b] - fish stay hooked twice as long, 2% chance after 10 quests
[*] [b]Pretty Lure[/b] - fish bite faster, guaranteed and 1% chance after 40 quests
[*] [b]Pretty Slippery Lure[/b] - Combined lure

[/list]
[/spoiler]

[size=6]Known Issues[/size]

[list]
[*] Fishing lines cast from your body instead of the fishing pole when using the new poles. I don't know why! If anyone knows how to fix this, please let me know! I didn't change anything related to the projectiles, they should all inherit vanilla pole and projectile data by default.
[*] Some items aren't fully implemented; notably the Alien Plankton and usable fish (e.g. Sporetooth Mushark).

- made CrabClaw only drop from every tenth crab, if it was spawned by statues
- extended the tooltip of the Zodiac by 'The brighter the better, the dimmer the slimmer. Normal at half moon' to get an idea of how its fishing power depends on the moon cycle

- obsolete items: HellCrate ("Underworld Crate"),
                  SandCrate ("Desert Crate"),
				  SeaCrate ("Ocean Crate"),
				  Shadow Lockbox,
				  SnowCrate ("Frozen Crate"),
				  SizzLine ("Sizzling Line") because there exists already the "Lavaproof Fishing Hook" in vanilla Terraria,
				  Charred Line --> was a material in SizzLine
				  
- boosted Jewel Fishing Rod from 1% to 40% fishing power so it doesn't fell like a big downgrade from The Voyager
- boosted Crab Claw bonus while using Jewel Fishing rod from +20 fishing power to +40 fishing power so it feels more rewarding to actually farm crab claws

- changed the "Twin Cattail Pole" to add 1 additional line, not doubling all the already available lines
- the "Enchanted Gnomon" now gives a proper chat message when using the Enchanted Sundial
- gave the "Honey Boost" and "Lava Boost" a 3 seconds buff time after leaving the respective liquid so it can be used more tactial
- the "Sporetooth" is now useable
- gave the "Ocarina" some nice use sound when used
- balanced the obtained money of the "Coin Hook"
- created the "Jig Collection", a combination of the 4 existing jigs, for QoL

- the described issue "Fishing lines cast from your body instead of the fishing pole when using the new poles" was fixed
- made the Flyfish projectile stay upward and gave it some dust tiles while flying
- created food holding sprites (they look nasty, need to be resprited in future...but I'm a horrible spriter)

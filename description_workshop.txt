This is the updated and overhauled version of the 1.3 tModLoader mod I played back in 2019.
I always liked the balance of the accessories and the new poles and didn't want to miss in my future playthoughs.
And why not make it available to the community ;-)

These are the fixes / changes I made:
- DrunkWisdom buff gave melee damage instead of magic damage
- Primordial Yeux, Primordial Nageoires and Primordial Ecailles had no sell value and item rarity declared
- FulgurShark had a range-plus of 8, reduced it to 1
- made CrabClaw only drop from every tenth crab, if it was spawned by statues
- extended the tooltip of the Zodiac by 'The brighter the better, the dimmer the slimmer. Normal at half moon' to give people an idea of how its fishing power depends on the moon cycle
- gave the new fishing junk tooltips and made them useable at the extractinator
- deleted all crates (except the Jeweled Crate) since all of them (except the Jeweled Crate) were added to vanilla Terraria in 1.4.0.1 "Journey's End"
- boosted Jewel Fishing Rod from 1% to 40% fishing power so it doesn't fell like a big downgrade from The Voyager
- boosted Crab Claw bonus while using Jewel Fishing rod from +20 fishing power to +40 fishing power so it feels more rewarding to actually farm crab claws
- the SonarStick is an accessory but actually worked when in the inventory. Changed it to only work when equipped
- changed the "Twin Cattail Pole" to add 1 additional line, not doubling all the already available lines (felt op to me)
- the "Enchanted Gnomon" now gives a proper chat message when using the Enchanted Sundial
- gave the "Honey Boost" and "Lava Boost" a 3 seconds buff time after leaving the respective liquid so it can be used more tactial
- the "Sporetooth" is now useable
- gave the "Ocarina" some nice use sound when used
- balanced the obtained money of the "Coin Hook"
- created the "Jig Collection", a combination of the 4 existing jigs, for QoL (the sprite looks nasty and needs to be resprited in the future...but I'm a horrible spriter)
- reels now have a small chance to fish an additional crate of the same type - big thanks to "direwolf420" a.k.a "Putan#1022" from tModLoader discord channel <3
- the described issue in the original mod homepage "Fishing lines cast from your body instead of the fishing pole when using the new poles" was fixed
- made the Flyfish projectile stay upward and gave it some dust tiles while flying
- created food holding sprites (they look nasty, need to be resprited in the future...but I'm a horrible spriter)

- list of deleted items: HellCrate ("Underworld Crate"),
                         SandCrate ("Desert Crate"),
                         SeaCrate ("Ocean Crate"),
                         Shadow Lockbox,
                         SnowCrate ("Frozen Crate"),
                         SizzLine ("Sizzling Line") because there exists already the "Lavaproof Fishing Hook" in vanilla Terraria,
                         Charred Line --> was a material in SizzLine

Big thanks for Fooksie for creating the original mod and everybody who helped me on the tModLoader "mod-programming-help" channel <3

Original mod description:
[url=https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/tacklebox-modest-fishing-content.61421/] Link [/url] to the Terraria forums post

Tacklebox adds a modest amount of supplementary fishing content throughout the game, mainly filling in the gaps left by the vanilla game. This includes...

- 30+ fresh new fish spread across Water, Lava, and Honey in the Desert, Mushroom, Meteorite, Dungeon, and other biomes previously lacking unique fish!
- 9 shiny fishing rods, including some with special properties!
- 6 unique, juicy baits!
- stylish fishing accessories!
- a gem fishing crate!
- new junk items, because...why of course!

...and more!

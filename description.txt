Tacklebox adds a modest amount of supplementary fishing content throughout the game, mainly filling in the gaps left by the vanilla game. This includes...

- 30+ fresh new fish spread across Water, Lava, and Honey in the Desert, Mushroom, Meteorite, Dungeon, and other biomes previously lacking unique fish!
- 9+ shiny fishing rods, including some with special properties!
- 6+ unique, juicy baits!
- stylish fishing accessories!
- new fishing crates, including the long lost ocean and tundra crates!
- new junk items, because of course!

...and more!

- make use of the GlowNet sprite
- maybe give the Wayward Bottle some cool twist -> Fooksie already thought of a "Wayward Scroll"....she wrote as if it was already in the mod...strange, maybe look ingame of the old 1.3 mod
- Some items aren't fully implemented; notably the Alien Plankton and the Crocodile mount (see: CrocTooth)
- Fooksie prepared an Angler Shop...make use of it?
